0x0 - 0x500, reserved
0x500 - 0x1000, memory map
0x1000 - 0x5000, page tables
0x5000+ bitmap
0x9FC00- stack
0x9FC00 - 0x100000, reserved
0x100000+ kernel and extra memory, defined by memory map at runtime

stack and bitmap grow towards each other and can theoretically overlap
mbr is at 0x600 but is overwritten later
E820 is at 0x5000 but is overwritten
vbr is at 0x7C00 but is fine to be overwritten by the bitmap
